# cannon

This gem is an implementation of the random number generators (aka cannons) described in "A Panoply of Stochastic 'Cannons'" (Lorrain, D. 1980, read it online for here: http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3679879?uid=3739560&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21104431233533 ). This code is (currently) ported directly from the Pascal implementations provided in the paper and as such is at times unreadable. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cannon'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:sdfsdf

    $ gem install cannon

## Usage

Once I finish implementing everything (I'm ~70% done) I'll add instructions here.
