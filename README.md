# cannon

This gem is an implementation of the random number generators (aka cannons) described in "A Panoply of Stochastic 'Cannons'" (Lorrain, D. 1980, read it online for [here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3679442). This code is (currently) ported directly from the Pascal implementations provided in the paper and as such is pretty much unreadable. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cannon'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:sdfsdf

    $ gem install cannon

## Usage

Once I finish implementing everything (I'm ~70% done) I'll add instructions here.
